2019-12-10 Version 0.12.1
  - Adapt tests to work with dkimpy 1.0.0 test dns API changes
  - Update PSL from upstream

2019-09-15 Version 0.12.0
  - Implement RFC 7489 Section 6.6.1 multi-valued from processing for DMARC
  - Implement support for distinct sub-domain policy ('sp' tag)
  - Include DMARC policy in addition to raw DMARC result in A-R response
  - Support 'np' non-existent domain policy (draft-ietf-dmarc-psd) in addition
    to 'p' and 'sp'
  - Fixed error with org domain determination in SPF portion of DMARC
    validation
  - Correct DMARC message from extraction so multiple from is properly
    detected

2019-04-24 Version 0.11.0
  - Add support for PSD (Public Suffix Domain) DMARC, draft-ietf-dmarc-psd
    - Check using local copy of psddmarc.org registry if present or
      psddmarc.org DNS lookup service if not
    - Add setup.py extension to add local copy of psddmarc.org registry
  - Correct DMARC processing so that domains without DMARC records correctly
    get a none result vice pass
  - Correct DMARC portion of test suite so DMARC record look-ups in the test
    data give an appropriate answer
  - Change email domain extraction regex so it finds a domain more than two
    lables (e.g. text.example.com)
  - Add comment to DMARC results in the output Authentication Results header
    field indicating if the DMARC record was from the from domain, the org
    domain, or (if enabled) the public suffix domain
  - Update PSL from upstream

2018-11-25 Version 0.10.0
  - Changed SPF check default to False in authenticate_message since pyspf is
    not in install_requires
  - Added new pslupdate option to setup.py so embedded public suffix list copy
    can be easily updated
  - Added new psllocal option to setup.py to set the location of a system
    public suffix list to use in lieu of the embedded copy
  - Only include domain part of Mail From address in smtp.mailfrom since RFC
    7601 says this is virtually always the right thing to do
  - Fixed SPF checks to they work and switched SPF check to use current vice
    legacy pyspf API
  - Fixed use of dnspython API in dmarc_lookup.py so DMARC records are
    correclty returned
  - Fixed dmarc_check to only use domain part of the Mail From address so SPF
    based DMARC checks work
  - Added version checks in setup.py so ipaddress is not required for
    python3.3 and later (since it is in the standard library)
  - Added COPYING file to document package licenses
  - Added CHANGES file (only covers 0.9.3 and later)

2018-10-30 Version 0.9.3
  - Swtiched to using upstream dkimpy, rather than obselete Valimail fork
