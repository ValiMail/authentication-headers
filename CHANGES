2018-11-25 Version 0.10.0
  - Changed SPF check default to False in authenticate_message since pyspf is
    not in install_requires
  - Added new pslupdate option to setup.py so embedded public suffix list copy
    can be easily updated
  - Added new psllocal option to setup.py to set the location of a system
    public suffix list to use in lieu of the embedded copy
  - Only include domain part of Mail From address in smtp.mailfrom since RFC
    7601 says this is virtually always the right thing to do
  - Fixed SPF checks to they work and switched SPF check to use current vice
    legacy pyspf API
  - Fixed use of dnspython API in dmarc_lookup.py so DMARC records are
    correclty returned
  - Fixed dmarc_check to only use domain part of the Mail From address so SPF
    based DMARC checks work
  - Added version checks in setup.py so ipaddress is not required for
    python3.3 and later (since it is in the standard library)
  - Added COPYING file to document package licenses
  - Added CHANGES file (only covers 0.9.3 and later)

2018-10-30 Version 0.9.3
